# Editor.UI

Boilerplate UI library to build opinionated custom inspectors quickly using bare-metal IMGUI (i.e. fast!).

## Introduction
The `Editor.UI` library is designed to provide a fast and efficient way to build custom inspectors in Unity using IMGUI. It aims to streamline the process of creating opinionated custom inspector UIs. This has been part of nearly every Unity project I worked on over the past 15 years.

## Features
- Fast performance with bare-metal IMGUI skipping attributes, decorators, property drawsers and all that stuff.
- Easy-to-use boilerplate for creating custom inspectors
- Opinionated design to promote best practices
- Fully written in C#

## Installation
Use UPM:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/azeitler/a6z6-editor-ui-unity.git
    ```
2. Open your Unity project and navigate to the `Assets` directory.
3. Copy the `Editor.UI` library files into the `Assets` directory of your Unity project.
4. Refresh the Unity Editor to recognize the new files.

## Usage
See ```Inspector``` (recommended) and ```BaseInspector```. Everything else is documented in the code.
